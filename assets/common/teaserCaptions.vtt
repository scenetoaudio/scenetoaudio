We present "Scene-to-Audio," a novel framework to 
convert distant scene images into representative

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:13.120
audio to provide a comprehensible and engaging 
experience for blind and low vision people.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.960
Vista scenes, like scenic landscapes, 
are essential for leisure and situational

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:24.440
awareness. Experiencing them is important 
for one’s cognitive and aesthetic needs. Yet,

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:30.000
these experiences remain inaccessible 
to people with visual impairments.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.040
Existing solutions like the app BeMyAI rely

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.200
heavily on spoken descriptions. These speech 
descriptions often impose a high cognitive

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.800
load and they lack immersive qualities 
necessary for an enjoyable experience.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.040
In this paper, we proposed a novel framework 
called 'Scene-to-Audio' that generates

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.480
non-verbal sounds to represent key elements 
of distant scenes. It identifies sound-making

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.160
objects in the scene and produces 
non-verbal audio using a combination

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.400
of psycho-acoustics and foley sound synthesis.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.560
Through a listening test with 21 
participants we show that the sounds

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.280
generated from our framework represent 
the scene better than baseline techniques,

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.880
with a high scene recognition accuracy 
and a high pleasantness rating.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.880
Through a pilot study with blind and low vision 
users or BLVs, we co-designed four auditory

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:01.400
feedback strategies to enhance their scene 
experience: Speech-only, Audio-only, Overlay, and

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:17.280
Overlay Concat. Here is an example: Speech-only.
Audio-only, which is the non-verbal audio

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:27.120
generated from scene-to-audio framework
Overlay, which is speech overlaid

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:38.960
on non-verbal sounds,
And Overlay concat, which is a

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.680
sequential audio representation of different parts 
of the scene, along with the corresponding speech.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:07.960
In a user study with 11 PVI participants, we 
compared these sonification strategies. Overlay

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.480
audio was preferred the most and rated 
to be significantly more immersive, and

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.920
engaging than the speech-only audio, while also 
being comprehensible and low in cognitive load.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.560
We envision integrating this framework 
with existing wearable technologies to

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.560
provide engaging and immersive audio 
experiences for Vista scenes for BLVs.
